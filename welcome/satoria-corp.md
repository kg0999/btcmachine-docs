We officially become, a Gaming Brand starting now. \
We are building Satoria!\
![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png>)

Our Focus will be\
&#x20;1\. Satoria - An MMORPG game inspired by decades of experience, over 30 000 hours each of sacrificing our lives to grinding and leveling up. SATORIA will be WEB2 focused with Ordinal integrations. Soon, you will be able to login with one of these assets:

* Machine
* Virus
* Mutant Virus
* Survivor

2.  We will focus on building QUALITY. The first 6 months were focused on expanding at an impossible rate. \
    Unsustainable rate.\
    Which is good.

    Our tentacles are now everywhere, without anyone noticing.

    We airdropped and gave free stuff to everyone.\
    Our focus will be on a selection of our key assets that will be directly integrated with SATORIA.

    Do not expect more free stuff

    Do not expect many more airdrops.

    Expect absolute quality, absolutely.
3.  Our second focus will be Physical.

    We have been very good at creating cool exclusive experiences.

    Like 509 or the Box, we want to continue doing that.

    For us this is a perfect way to build a business, grow our brand and keep delivering cool shit. Expect more physical drops
4. Finally, $ZBIT is our main currency. This will be used in-game. For physical drops. For our entire Satorian brand and ecosystem. We are the only business delivering actual utility to our BRC20 and we will continue building on top of it.
