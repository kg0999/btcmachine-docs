# Pirate Jess - Letter from CEO

Supply 99\


When claiming zbit from ordinalsbot, a person with discord name Jess was able to claim over 2.1M zbits and started dumping on unisat marketplace. Community and team acted quickly and bought the entire supply from hacker Jess. Team then inscribed a supply of 99 Ordinals to commemorate this event.\
