# BTC Domination

BTC Domination was one of the most engaging projects in the ecosystem! \
\
Team asked the community to help BTCM hunt Inscription #1000000. \
\
During that epic adventure, the community inscribed thousands of BTC logos by themselves, trying to catch the inscription. \
\
An opportunity for all to learn about inscriptions and transaction fees, but also, proving how strong the BTC Machine community really is! \
\
For many, this was their first ordinal, and they inscribed it themselves !\
